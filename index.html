<h2>How to make scrambled eggs</h2>
	<p><ol>
	<li>Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in small bowl. Melt butter in non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
	<li>Pour in egg mixture and reduce heat to medium-low. As eggs begin to set, gently move spatula across bottom and side of skillet to form large, soft curds.</li>
	<li>Cook until eggs are thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, but the eggs are not dry.</li>
	<li>Put eggs on a plate and enjoy!</li>
	</ol></p>

	
<h2>How to make an omlet</h2>	
	<p><ol>
	<li>Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.</li>
	<li>Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.</li>
	<li>Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.</li>
	<li>Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds</li>
	<li>Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.</li>

<h2>How to make a hard boiled egg</h2>
	<p><ol>
	<li>First, boil the eggs. Place them in a pot and cover them with cold water by 1 inch. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li>
	<li>Then, let them sit in the hot water. As soon as the water begins to boil, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Leave the eggs in the hot water for anywhere from 10-12 minutes, depending on how you like your eggs. The 10-minute eggs will have vibrant, creamy yolks, while the 12-minute yolks will be paler and opaque, with a chalkier texture.</li>
	<li>Finally, move them to an ice bath. When the time is up, drain the eggs and transfer them to a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Leave them in the ice bath for at least 14 minutes before you peel the eggs.
<br>
	If you’re not planning to eat the eggs right away, feel free to leave them in the shells and store them in the fridge. But even if this is the case, don’t cut the ice bath short! It’s crucial for stopping the cooking process and making the eggs easy to peel later on.</li>
	<li>Put egg on a plate and enjoy!</li>
